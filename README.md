## 🧩 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Visualization
A project demonstrating how to visualize complex datasets using various chart types like bar graphs, line plots, pie charts, and scatter plots.  
The focus is on making data insights easy to understand through visual representation.

**Key Libraries:**
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- pandas

### 3️⃣ Time Series Analysis of Retail Sales
This final project explores a **time series dataset** from a retail store to analyze sales trends over time.  
It uses **Python data analysis** tools to identify seasonal patterns, peak sales periods, and potential business insights.

An interactive **Tkinter-based GUI** is also implemented to allow users to:
- Load and view sales data  
- Filter data by date or category  
- Generate line charts and trend visualizations dynamically  

**Key Libraries:**
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- tkinter
